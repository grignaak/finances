get rid of Dollars#balance ??
get rid of Section#sub_items

adding/removing a contribution in one category should do same it in src/dest

a contribution doesn't affect monthly percentage
--unless the carry_over balance goes to zero

an allowance can either be a percentage or a fixed amount -- not both
updates to the income should reflect in the allowance of the categories

names on sections. categories too?
