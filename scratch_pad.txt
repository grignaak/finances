A category has carry-over balance, a list of spendings, a balance from this
month and to-be-carried-over balance, and two lists of contributions (giving,
receiving)

The to-be-carried-over balance is (new-balance + carry-over + contributions) -
(spendings + contributions)

a contribution is a liability from one category and an asset in another
